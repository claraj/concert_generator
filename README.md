Generates random band names.

Because English is English and music artists give themselves creative names, combining random words can generate both amusing names, realistic band names, actual band names, and potentially offensive names. All the names are generated at random from a wordlist that has many (but probably not all) potentially offensive words removed. Any further words you think should be removed, please let me know.
